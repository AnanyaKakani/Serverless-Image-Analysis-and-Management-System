# Serverless-Image-Analysis-and-Management-System

**Overview**
This project implements a serverless architecture for automated image analysis and management using AWS services such as S3, SQS, Lambda, and Rekognition. The system allows for seamless processing of image uploads, analysis of content, and communication of results, demonstrating advanced proficiency in cloud-based solutions.

**Features**
Automated image analysis utilizing AWS Rekognition for enhanced operational efficiency and accuracy.
Event-driven workflow for seamless processing of image uploads and analysis.
Communication of analysis results via AWS SNS.
Robust AWS S3 lifecycle policy for optimized image storage and retention.

**Implementation Details**
**Architecture**
The system is built on a serverless architecture, leveraging AWS services including:

Amazon S3 for storage of image files.
Amazon SQS for queuing image analysis tasks.
AWS Lambda for executing analysis functions.
Amazon Rekognition for image analysis.
Amazon SNS for communication of analysis results.

**Workflow**
Image uploads trigger events in Amazon S3.
Events are processed by AWS Lambda functions.
Lambda functions enqueue analysis tasks in Amazon SQS.
SQS messages trigger Lambda functions for image analysis using Rekognition.
Analysis results are communicated via Amazon SNS.

**AWS S3 Lifecycle Policy**
A robust AWS S3 lifecycle policy has been designed and executed for optimized image storage and retention. This policy ensures compliance and cost-effectiveness through automated data management.

**Usage**
To deploy and use the Serverless Image Analysis and Management System, follow these steps:

> Clone the repository.
> Set up AWS credentials and configure AWS services.
> Deploy the serverless architecture using AWS CloudFormation or Serverless Framework.
> Upload images to the designated S3 bucket for analysis.
> Monitor analysis results through the configured SNS topic.
